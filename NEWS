* modified sortdf so 'form' can be a variable or list, not just a formula
2018-11-21
* added freq argument to 'up' to summarize factor using frequencies. Useful to create data grouped by predictor variables with frequencies for levels of response variable for binomial glm with goodness of fit test

* added brace
2018-04-12
* added verbose argument to Rbind
2018-03-18
