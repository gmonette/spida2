\description{
This is a classical data set from the field of education used to illustrate
multilevel data and models. It is used in the first edition of Bryk and Raudenbush.
\code{hsfull} is the complete data set with 160 high schools,
\code{hs} is a random subset of 40 high schools, \code{hs1} is a random subset of
80 schools and \code{h2} contains the complement of \code{hs1}.  These two subsets
can be used to illustrate split sample validation: develop a model on one half of the data
and assess its performance on the other.
}
\details{
Each row consists of the data for one student.   \code{hsfull} is the complete data set. \code{hs1} and \code{hs2}
are complementary split halves of the schools in the data. \code{hs} is a selection of 40 schools
which seems to be a good number of clusters for presentations in class.
