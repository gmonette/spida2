\title{Create a data frame at a higher level of aggregation with a possible incidence matrix for categorical factors}
\usage{
agg(
  object,
  form = formula(object),
  agg = NULL,
  sep = "_",
  sep.clus = "/",
  na.rm = TRUE,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{a data frame to be aggregated.}

\item{form}{a one-sided formula or a list or data frame identifying the variable(s) in \code{object}
that identifies clusters. e.g. ~ school/Sex to get a summary within each Sex
of each school.}

\item{agg}{a one-sided formula or a list or data frame identifying the variable(s) in \code{object}
to be aggregated.}

\item{sep}{(default _) separator to separate variable name from variable value when
aggregating a factor variable.}

\item{sep.clust}{(default /) separator to form cluster names combining more than one
clustering variables.  If the separator leads to the same name for distinct
clusters (e.g. if var1 has levels 'a' and 'a/b' and var2 has levels 'b/c'
and 'c') the function produces an error and a different separator should be
used.}

\item{FUN}{(default cvar) function to be used for summaries.}
}
\value{
a data frame with one row per value of the variable in \code{form} and
aggregate variabless for each variable name in \code{agg}
}
\description{
Produce a higher level data set with one row per cluster. The data set
contains variables that are invariant in each cluster and, optionally, summaries
of other variables (means for numeric variables and blocks of variables
corresponding to incidence matrices for factors.
