\description{
Return a table as as data frame
}
\details{
The right hand side of 'fmla' is used for the dimensions of the table. The
left-hand side, if present, is summed to generate the values in the cells of the table. If there is no
left-hand side, cell frequencies are shown.

\code{tab_df(data, fmla)} is similar in effect to \code{as.data.frame(tab_(data, fmla))} except
that the former uses the name in the LHS of \code{fmla} as a variable name for counts while the latter
uses 'Freq'. Also, \code{tab_df} preserved ordered factors.
