\usage{
rnd(x, digits, ...)

\method{rnd}{default}(x, ...)

\arguments{
\item{x}{an object to be rounded and formatted}

\item{digits}{significant digits for variation in x}

\item{...}{passed on to \code{\link{format}} function}
}
\description{
Round to a given number of significant digits to show variability in a vector of numbers.
}
\details{
Instead of rounding to a given number of significant digits, or rounding
to a given significance, 'rnd' rounds so that the variability in a set of
number is exhibited to a given number of digits. For example, 100.1233, 100.2345, 100.3456,
rounded to 3 significant digits would be 100., 100., 100., but rounded to 3 significant
digits for variability is 100.123, 100.234, 100.345.
