\title{Transform output of a Wald test into a data frame}
\usage{
\method{as.data.frame}{wald}(obj, se = 2, digits = 3, sep = "", which = 1, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{obj}{a 'wald' object}

\item{se}{a vector with the multiples of standard error used to generate lower and upper limits. 'names(se)'
is appended to 'L' and 'U' to label the variables.}

\item{which}{selects elements of 'obj' to turn to a data.frame.}
}
\value{
A data frame with estimated coefficient, standard error, and, optionally, upper and lower limits and
the variables included the 'data' element of 'obj' if present. The 'wald' object is
returned as the 'wald' attribute so p-values, for example, can be obtained with
attr(ret, 'wald')$estimate$\code{p-value}
If \code{length(which) > 1}, the returned object is a list of data frames.

\description{
The generic method is included in the possibly false hope that it will ensure that the method
in this package is used.
